```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

Write some functions.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 2, sd = 1.6)
y = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 1.58, sd = 1.58)


z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
z_again = (x_again - mean(x_again)) / sd(x_again)

```

So complicated, let's write function instead.

```{r}
# input in the first parenthesis
z_score = function(x) {
  
# conditional execution, make sure it breaks at the right time
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("you are doing something wrong")
  } else if (length(x) <= 3) {
    stop("hey the data length is too small")
  }
  
  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
}

z_score(c(1,2,3))
z_score(x_again)
z_score(y)
```

Test another function.
```{r}
mean_sd_function = function(input_x) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
  stop("you are doing something wrong")
  } else if (length(x) <= 3) {
    stop("hey the data length is too small")
    }
  list(
  mean_x = mean(input_x),
  sd_x = sd(input_x),
  zscore = (input_x - mean(input_x)) / sd(input_x) )
}

mean_sd_function(y)

```
